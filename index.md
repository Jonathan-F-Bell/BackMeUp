## About
(for now, this is just my abstract, but it will be updated to be more informative about the website itself and why I made it)
As our work and lives continue to move into the realm of digital media, drive failure, accidental deletion, theft, fire, and other unforeseen circumstances can cause the loss of hours, days ,or years worth of work if proper backups are not made. It can be complex and confusing to create a comprehensive backup system that can protect against all these potential failure points, especially for those who are not as proficient with technology. BackMeUp.net provides a straightforward and easy to understand resource to help guide people through the process of setting up backups of their important data to both local and offsite locations. The project takes the form of an interactive website which allows the user to tailor the guide to their needs and interests. The guide can provide information about various combinations of desktop and phone backup solutions and can be adjusted to give more or less background information about the specific solution choices depending on the interest level of the user. Hopefully, this project will help people to keep backups of their important data, leading to less data loss and, as a result, reduce instances of loss of work, time, and money for those who rely on digital files for their livelihoods.
